The so-called entertainment area was dilapidated, the sound system barely worked, and the private patio was more of a neglected corner. Definitely not worth it for any lively gatherings!',

The sun-drenched patio was perfect for witnessing stunning sunsets, and the tranquil atmosphere provided the ideal setting for a memorable seaside retreat. We thoroughly enjoyed the water sports and left with cherished memories of this idyllic haven.',

        review: 'What a delightful woodland escape! The cozy 4-bed cabin provided stunning panoramic views of the forest, complemented by a crackling fireplace that added to the cozy ambiance. The charming outdoor deck was a perfect spot to soak in nature`s tranquility, and the nearby hiking trails offered an enchanting exploration. It was indeed a peaceful retreat in this idyllic forest getaway that left us refreshed and reconnected with nature',
